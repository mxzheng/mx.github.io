I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at University of Central Florida. Prior that, I obtained Ph.D. at the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington in 2023. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Shandong University in 2018. My research interests mainly lie in machine learning security, especially backdoor attacks/defense for AI models and AI Data Privacy Protection.
