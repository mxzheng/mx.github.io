I am Mengxin Zheng, a 5th year PhD student at at the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington, working with Dr Lei Jiang.  Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at ShanDong University in 2018. My research interests mainly lie in machine learning security, especially backdoor attacks/defense for AI models and AI Data Privacy Protection.
